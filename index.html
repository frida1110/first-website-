    <h1>Cookie Invention</h1>
    <p>The first cookies were made in Persia (modern-day Iran) in the 7th century. They were <b>originally</b> small cakes baked to test the oven temperature before the main cake was baked. The concept of cookies spread to Europe and eventually to the United States, where they became a popular treat.</p>
